        <h2 id="subheading2">Introduction to Frontend Web Development</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="tutorial1/frontend_webdev.png" alt="Frontend Development">
        <p>Frontend web development is the practice of converting data into a graphical interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so users can view and interact with it.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="subheading2">Like in this tutorial, the website you are viewing is also a frontend web</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="tutorial1/web.png" alt="web">
        <p>Above, you can see a screenshot of the same website. At the top, there is the heading, followed by the navbar, which contains a dropdown I customized for a better look. Below, there are subheadings 1 and 2, added using IDs, with a chosen background color. This is an example of frontend development.</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="subheading2">Where can Frontend be used ü§î?</h2>
        <p>Frontend development can be used in many areas, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Web Development üíª</li>
            <li>Mobile Development üì±</li>
            <li>Desktop Development üñ•Ô∏è</li>
            <li>Game Development üéÆ</li>
            <li>And many more...</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <img src="tutorial1/portfolio.png" alt="Portfolio">
        <p>You can use frontend development to create your own portfolio, making it attractive and easy to navigate for users. Above is an example of a portfolio I created using HTML and CSS as part of an internship task. I am currently doing a frontend development internship.</p>
        <br>
        <img src="tutorial1/company.png" alt="company">
        <p>You can also build a visually appealing company website to attract users. A simple yet engaging design improves usability. The image above shows a company website I developed using HTML and CSS, another internship task.üôÇ </p>
        <br>
        <img src="tutorial1/band.png" alt="band">
        <p>A final example is creating a frontend website for an artist or band. The example above is a site I built during my internship. So far, I have completed three projects, but I plan to do more as my internship go. Follow my tutorials to see them all üòâ I will also explain the code and process in detail soon in upcomings videos and tutorial, covering everything from basics to advanced concepts in frontend development. Stay tuned for more üòä</p>
        <br>
        <h2 id="subheading2">What will be in this playlist and Text Tutorials</h2>
        <p> In this playlist (also the Text Tutorials), I first cover the basic topics of frontend web development, not the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, as I assume you already know them. However, I will be covering the advanced topics of HTML and CSS, such as how to create a nice navbar, buttons, color gradients, and many more. After covering these, I will showcase the projects mentioned above and demonstrate the code, explaining how I implement them using basic HTML and CSS. Then, I will move on to Python and JavaScript, using frameworks like Flask and React, both of which are frontend frameworks. 
            So stay tuned for it üòä </p>
